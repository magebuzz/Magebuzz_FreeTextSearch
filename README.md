# Free Text Search
> Free Text Search extension is a simple and effective solution for your Magento search feature. Instead of limited searching by specific product names, customers are able to search based on general keywords, SKU numbers and manufacturer names. 


* Return search result for both products & CMS pages
* Quickly display search suggest result using Ajax


## Features
   Search for CMS pages

When your online store offers multiple services and products, it's sometimes difficult for customers to navigate to what they are looking for. Even with a menu navigation or footer link, your patrons need a simple way to search through your extensive database. That's where our Free Text Search Module comes in; a customer can easily enter a keyword in a simple search input field, and find the most relevant results.


   Exact and relevant results

A simple Magento search will only produce results within the exact keyword searched, showing only those products with that same keyword. With our Free Text Search extension, your customers can search your database by product SKU, manufacturer, or a general keyword search. This gives shoppers a better chance to find exactly what they need. 

   Quick and convenient searching 

Instead of reloading the users page after each search to display results in a grid or list mode, our Free Text Search module can return top results in a separate window. This saves your customers time searching, giving them more time to spend looking at your products.
